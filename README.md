# Advent of Code 2024

Here is a page displaying my results for this year's AOC : https://julien-ctr.github.io/AdventOfCode2024/

## Folder structure

- Ensure that your inputs are in a folder named `inputs` located at the root of the project.
- Each input file should be named after the corresponding day (e.g., `day_09.txt`).

## Building the project

- To build a specific day, run:

```bash
make day_XX
```
(For example, to build Day 5, run `make day_05`.)

- To build all days at once, simply run:
```bash
make
```

## Running the project

- To run all days and display the results, first run:
```bash
make run_all
```
- Then, launch the newly created executable (`run_all`).
